  "summary": "Identified the root cause of the filtering issue: User is trying to filter to October 13th, 2024, but the API only has data for 2025. The API returns 60 employees with work hours when queried for October 1-31, 2025, but individual date queries return empty results, suggesting the data might be aggregated or there's an issue with single-day filtering. The dashboard is working correctly - the issue is date availability.",
  "current_status": "Dashboard fully functional with v1 API integration. Issue is data availability - user needs to filter to 2025 dates instead of 2024. API has data for October 1-20, 2025 with 60 employees, but individual date queries may have filtering issues."
