  "summary": "Successfully resolved the issue where test HTML files were accessible at 10.100.6.3:3000/timezone-fix.html. Fixed package.json to include proper React dependencies, updated .dockerignore to exclude test HTML files and disabled components, rebuilt Docker image, and restarted container. Now only index.html is accessible - test files return 404 as expected.",
  "current_status": "Issue resolved - single-page React dashboard now serves only index.html without exposing test HTML files. All test files (timezone-fix.html, test-api.html, etc.) now return 404 Not Found, while the main dashboard works correctly."
