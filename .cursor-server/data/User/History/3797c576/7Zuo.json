  "summary": "Successfully updated the React dashboard to use v1 API endpoints with proper timezone support. Updated nginx configuration to proxy /api/v1/ to http://10.0.20.6:5001/api/v1/, rewrote API service to call v1 endpoints (work-hours, break-time, violations) with Asia/Karachi timezone, and rebuilt the Docker container. However, the v1 API endpoints described in the documentation don't exist yet on the backend server - only basic Frigate API endpoints (cameras, timeline, clips) are available. The backend needs to implement the v1 endpoints before the dashboard can display data.",
  "current_status": "Frontend ready for v1 API - nginx configured, API service rewritten, timezone handling implemented, container deployed. Backend v1 API endpoints (/api/v1/employees/work-hours, /api/v1/employees/break-time, /api/v1/violations/cell-phones) need to be implemented on the server at 10.0.20.6:5001 to complete the integration."
