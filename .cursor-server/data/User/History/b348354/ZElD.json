  "summary": "Successfully fixed the single-page setup - test HTML files are no longer accessible (404) and only index.html is served. However, the dashboard shows 'Error loading dashboard 404' because the API endpoints that the React app expects (/api/employees/work-hours, /api/violations/cell-phones, /api/employees/break-time) don't exist on the backend server. The nginx proxy is correctly configured to point to 10.100.6.2:5002, but the API server doesn't have these specific endpoints implemented yet.",
  "current_status": "Single-page setup complete - only index.html accessible, test files properly excluded. Dashboard loads but shows error because required API endpoints are not implemented on the backend server. Need to either implement the missing endpoints or modify the React app to use available endpoints."
